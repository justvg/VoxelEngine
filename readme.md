## Description

*The code has NOT been polished and is provided "as is". There are a lot of code that are redundant and there are tons of improvements that can be made.*

The engine implements the following (and more):
- Voxel engine with chunks 
- View frustum culling for chunks
- Entity system and simulation region
- Job system
- Simple math lib
- Qubicle binary file loading
- Collision detection with chunks

Features to add necessarily:
- Collision detection with entities (must be easy to add now)
- Better world generation 
- Entity AI
